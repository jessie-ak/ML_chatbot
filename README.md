# 🤖 Hybrid AI Chatbot

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Hybrid AI Chatbot** that combines **rule-based logic** with **machine learning concepts** to simulate intelligent conversational behavior.

The chatbot is designed as a **learning-focused AI project**, demonstrating how traditional logic-based systems can be enhanced using machine learning to improve flexibility and decision-making.

## 🧠 Why a Hybrid Chatbot?
- **Rule-based systems** are fast and predictable but limited.
- **Machine learning systems** are flexible but require careful evaluation.

By combining both approaches, this chatbot reflects how **real-world AI systems balance logic and learning** rather than relying on a single technique.
